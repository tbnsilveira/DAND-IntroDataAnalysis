## Medical appointment no-shows

This analysis is part of the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree program and aims to explore a dataset containing aproximately 100k medical appointments from the Brazilian public health system. It is basically divided into four sections: (1) Introduction, where the investigation problem is set and the dataset is described; (2) Data Wrangling, where the acquired data are cleaned and parsed; (3) Exploratory Data Analysis, in which some intuition about the data are built based on the found patterns; (4) Conclusion, where the found insights about the problem are reviewed and communicated.

The notebook is coded in Python and [it can be viewed here at GitHub](https://github.com/tbnsilveira/DAND-IntroDataAnalysis/blob/master/tbnsilveira_Project01_InvestigateDataset.ipynb), rendered as a static HTML file, or at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tsilveira/applying-heatmaps-for-categorical-data-analysis), where a full featured visualization is provided.

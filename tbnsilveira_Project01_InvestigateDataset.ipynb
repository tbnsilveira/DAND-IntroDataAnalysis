    "\n",
    "The Brazilian public health system, known as SUS for *Unified Health System* in its acronym in Portuguese, is one of the largest health system in the world <a href=\"#[1]\">[1]</a>, representing government investment of more than 9% of GDP. However, its operation is not homogeneous and there are distinct perceptions of quality from citizens in different regions of the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis will use the *no-show appointments dataset* which collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment, with a number of characteristics about the patient included in each row:\n",
    "- ‘ScheduledDay’: tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.  \n",
    "- ‘Neighborhood’: indicates the location of the hospital.  \n",
    "- ‘Scholarship’: indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program called *Bolsa Família*.\n",
    "- 'No-show': it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis aims to outline the reasons for patient no-showing to scheduled appointments, as well as get insights about the Brazilian public health system. To accomplish this, we will first try to understand the data and the context on which they were collected. We will then proceed to data wrangling and exploratory data analysis, in an iterative process, in order to draw some conclusions about the subject."

    "Since the original dataset is available at Kaggle <a href=\"#[2]\">[2]</a>, the first step was to get additional information available on its original repository, as transcripted below:\n",
    "\n",
    ">In response here it goes: Country? Brazil Is this from private or public service? Or both? Public Sector (Brazil) Primary, secondary, or tertiary care? Primary care, not sure about it. Only physicians? What would be the specialties? We don't have these information.\n",
    "  \n",
    ">First appointment with that specific professional? --> I believe first appointments are prone to \"no show\". That is a very good hint, we don't have that information yet. Part of the day? --> Early morning might be worse. (Perhaps in the next version we can include it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another relevant point is that any information is provided about the source of data. I.e., did these data come from a government agency or were they a compilation from each health unit? Furthermore, besides it is known the data is about public health unit, it is not said from which government sphere they belong to (municipal, state or federal). \n",
    "The absence of such information can result in a biased analysis, since the complex and decentralized Brazilian health system brings inevitable conflicts and contradictions between its associated entities, as identified in <a href=\"#[3]\">[3]</a>."
